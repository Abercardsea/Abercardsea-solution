# Bidder

Here will be the programs that will preform the bidding.

To test run this module using 

```bash
python -m bidder
```
use the submit orders mock to check that the post request is working.

Make sure that time of submissions and post function changes for the RSE api, as currently using a postman url for testing. 
(It should be configured to place a bid each day at around 7am.)

Testing has only been done on.

# First Time Set Up.

run start_bidder.sh it will create the database and start the bidder.
